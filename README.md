Primary focus of mine was to build a robust **backend architecture**, to be transparent I didn't created frontend due to focus on backend. And I have run my backend on cloud based server, **codedamn**, due to lack of compatibility of system in using vision api.

**In backend I implemented** 
*Image processing and filtering of relevant data with help of Vision api.
*Focused on **error handling** and precise OCR reading from ID cards.
*Wrote write operations for pushing the data read from images.
*Implemented querying(**retrieving data** from) the Database, done through ID numbers and **providing update and delete options** for further higher level of control over data as expected.
***Hosted a live database** with proper schema, that'll save uploaded image data over the course of time.
*Got the expected result output for **3 sample ID cards**.
